# Raytracing

A simple raytracing simulation written in C using SDL2.

## Building and Running

1. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Configure the project with CMake:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the executable:
   ```
   make
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```
   ./raytracing
   ```

## Dependencies

This project uses a vendored SDL2 library, so no additional dependencies other than CMAKE are required.
